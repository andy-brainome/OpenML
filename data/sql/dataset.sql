The character images were based on 20 different fonts and each\r\n    letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of\r\n    20,000 unique stimuli.  Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive\r\n    numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then\r\n    scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.  We\r\n    typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model\r\n    to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000.
